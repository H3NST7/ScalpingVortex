## I. Executive Summary

ScalpingVortex is an institutional-grade Expert Advisor (EA) meticulously engineered for high-frequency scalping operations exclusively on the XAUUSD (Gold) market within the MetaTrader 5 platform. This system represents a sophisticated synthesis of quantitative trading principles, robust software architecture, and advanced risk management protocols. Its primary design objective is to achieve consistent alpha generation and facilitate systematic capital growth, particularly enabling the scaling of trading accounts from modest initial balances to significant capital thresholds.

The architecture emphasizes modularity, computational efficiency, resilience, and adaptability, aiming to provide a durable edge in the dynamic and highly competitive XAUUSD environment.

## II. Architectural Philosophy & Design Principles

ScalpingVortex is built upon a foundation of modern software engineering and quantitative finance best practices:

*   **Object-Oriented Design (OOP):** Leverages encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for a clean, modular, and extensible codebase.
*   **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** Each module possesses a distinct, well-defined responsibility, promoting clarity and maintainability.
*   **High Cohesion, Low Coupling:** Modules are internally focused and externally independent, minimizing cascading changes and simplifying testing.
*   **Data-Driven & Empirically Validated:** The system is designed to support strategies and parameters that can be rigorously backtested, optimized, and statistically validated.
*   **Resilience & Fault Tolerance:** Robust error handling, state management, and graceful degradation are implemented to ensure operational stability.
*   **Performance-Critical Implementation:** Core logic paths are optimized for low-latency execution, crucial for high-frequency scalping.
*   **Adaptive Risk Management:** Risk is not merely a constraint but an integral component of the growth engine, dynamically adjusted based on market conditions and portfolio performance.

## III. System Components & Modules

ScalpingVortex employs a modular architecture, with each component residing in its dedicated include file within the `MQL5/Include/ScalpingVortex/` directory.

1.  **`ScalpingVortex.mq5` (Main EA Orchestrator):**
    *   Entry point for MetaTrader 5.
    *   Manages global EA parameters, event handling (`OnInit`, `OnTick`, etc.), and lifecycle.
    *   Instantiates and coordinates the `CSVCore`.

2.  **`SVCore.mqh` (`CSVCore` Class - Central Nervous System):**
    *   The core logic unit, orchestrating interactions between all other modules.
    *   Manages EA state, the main trading loop, and signal flow.

3.  **`SVMarketAnalyzer.mqh` (`CSVMarketAnalyzer` Class - Market Intelligence):**
    *   Provides comprehensive, real-time, and historical analysis for XAUUSD.
    *   Calculates scalping-relevant indicators (ATR, EMAs, RSI, Stoch, Bollinger Bands).
    *   Analyzes market microstructure: spread, tick velocity, volatility regimes, session dynamics.

4.  **`SVRiskEngine.mqh` (`CSVRiskEngine` Class - Capital Preservation & Growth):**
    *   Implements sophisticated, multi-layered risk management protocols.
    *   Features dynamic position sizing (volatility-normalized), adaptive SL/TP logic, portfolio-level drawdown controls, and trade management rules (break-even, trailing stops).

5.  **`SVStrategies.mqh` (`CSVStrategyBase` & Concrete Strategies - Alpha Generation):**
    *   Houses the specific trading algorithms.
    *   Includes a base class for strategy definition and concrete implementations (e.g., `CSVRangeFadeScalper`, `CSVImpulseRiderScalper`).
    *   Strategies utilize `CSVMarketAnalyzer` for data and `CSVRiskEngine` for risk parameters.

6.  **`SVTradeManager.mqh` (`CSVTradeManager` Class - Execution Precision):**
    *   Manages all aspects of order placement, modification, and closure.
    *   Employs asynchronous order handling, slippage control, retry mechanisms, and robust error processing.

7.  **`SVOptimizer.mqh` (`CSVOptimizer` Class - Parameter & Performance Hub):**
    *   Facilitates parameter set management and provides hooks for adaptive parameter tuning.
    *   Crucially, supports detailed trade logging during `OnTester` for external performance analysis.

8.  **`SVUtils.mqh` (Static `CSVUtils` / Namespace `SVUtils` - Utility Toolkit):**
    *   Provides common functionalities: advanced logging, date/time utilities, XAUUSD financial property retrieval, error formatting.

9.  **`SVPortfolio.mqh` (`CSVPortfolio` Class - Holistic Performance Accounting):**
    *   Tracks overall account and EA performance metrics: P&L, equity, drawdown, win rates, profit factor.
    *   Interfaces with `CSVRiskEngine` to enforce portfolio-level risk limits.

## V. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone/Download Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/ScalpingVortex.git
    ```
    Or download the ZIP and extract.

2.  **File Placement:**
    *   Copy the `ScalpingVortex.mq5` file to your MetaTrader 5 Data Folder: `[MT5 Data Folder]/MQL5/Experts/`.
    *   Create a `ScalpingVortex` subdirectory within `[MT5 Data Folder]/MQL5/Include/`.
    *   Copy all `.mqh` files (`SVCore.mqh`, `SVMarketAnalyzer.mqh`, etc.) into `[MT5 Data Folder]/MQL5/Include/ScalpingVortex/`.

3.  **Compilation:**
    *   Open MetaEditor from your MetaTrader 5 terminal.
    *   Navigate to `Experts/ScalpingVortex.mq5` in the Navigator window.
    *   Open `ScalpingVortex.mq5` and click "Compile" (or press F7).
    *   Ensure compilation completes without errors or warnings (strict mode is recommended).

4.  **EA Configuration (Input Parameters):**
    When attaching ScalpingVortex to a XAUUSD chart, you will be presented with a range of input parameters. Key categories include:
    *   **Global Settings:** Magic Number, Logging Level.
    *   **Risk Management:** Max Risk per Trade (%), Max Daily Drawdown (%), Volatility Settings.
    *   **Strategy-Specific Parameters:** Settings for each implemented scalping strategy (e.g., indicator periods, thresholds).
    *   **Trade Management:** Spread Filter, Slippage Allowance.
    *   **Session & News Filters:** Time windows for activity/inactivity.

    **It is CRITICAL to understand each parameter before live trading. Start with conservative settings on a demo account.**

## VI. Usage Guidelines & Best Practices

*   **DEMO TRADING FIRST:** Extensively test ScalpingVortex on a demo account under various market conditions before considering live deployment.
*   **XAUUSD Chart Only:** This EA is specifically designed for XAUUSD. Performance on other instruments is not guaranteed and not recommended.
*   **Timeframe:** While adaptable, scalping strategies often perform best on lower timeframes (e.g., M1, M5). Test to find optimal settings.
*   **Broker Selection:** A broker with low spreads, fast execution, and minimal slippage on XAUUSD is paramount for scalping success.
*   **VPS Recommended:** For consistent operation and low latency, running ScalpingVortex on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) located close to your broker's servers is highly recommended.
*   **Parameter Optimization:** Utilize MetaTrader 5's Strategy Tester to optimize input parameters for your specific broker and market conditions. The `SVOptimizer.mqh` module is designed to output detailed trade logs for advanced external analysis (e.g., using Python, R, or specialized software like QuantAnalyzer).
*   **Start Small:** When transitioning to live trading, begin with the smallest possible risk settings and lot sizes to validate performance in the live environment.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the EA's performance, logs, and the overall market environment. No trading system is a "set and forget" solution.
